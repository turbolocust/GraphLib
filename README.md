# GraphLib
A standard graph library that supports creating directed and undirected Graphs with edge weights using either:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Adjacency list, or</li>
  <li>Adjacency matrix</li>
</ul>
<br>
Also supports colors for edges and vertices plus checks for Eulerian characteristics.
<br />
This library requires at least Java 6 (Java 1.6).
