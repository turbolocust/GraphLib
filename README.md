# GraphLib
A standard graph library that supports creating directed and undirected Graphs with edge weights using:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Adjacency list, or</li>
  <li>Adjacency matrix</li>
</ul>
<br>
Also supports colors for edges and vertices, depth-first-search to find all paths and check for Eulerian characteristics.
